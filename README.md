üìå Project Summary

 The goal of this project is to analyze patient health data and pinpoint important heart disease risk factors using a Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard.  The dashboard offers insights and interactive visualizations to help comprehend patterns that might point to possible heart-related problems.

 ‚ùì Problem Description

 In what ways can data analytics aid in the comprehension of heart disease risk factors?

 Which factors have the biggest effects on heart disease, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.?

 Can medical decision-making be enhanced by visual insights?

Perspectives

 Heart disease is more likely to occur in older age groups and those with higher cholesterol.

 According to the dataset, males exhibit a slightly higher tendency than females.

 Exercise, blood pressure, and other lifestyle factors have a big influence on results.

 Concluding remarks

 This project serves as an example of how data analysis and visualization can support early detection strategies for heart disease and offer valuable insights into healthcare.
